add auth check on dashboard/

ADD/EDIT RUN:
date picker --> and add validation to add specific format, maybe with regex
input validtion for all types --> make seconds be at least 1, with regex
validate to catch when mph breaks with a near divide by zero. maybe a run must be at least 5 minutes long
don't allow a date in the future

replace welcome.blade with login template and setup the rerouting depending on login or not

create a function that shows seconds as 0:00:00
