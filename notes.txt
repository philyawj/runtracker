I want to find the min year someone has created a goal
then increase until current year
then add one

add a show goal page that's next year or year after. dashboard/goals/2020
create a dropdown for this on the goals page - two years ahead and 2 back


need to add validation to edit/add goals - must only input number
on goal create page - check if goal already exists under that page. If yes, go back to goals page and flash a message.

turn off password reset routes/ability

add auth check on dashboard/

ADD/EDIT RUN:
date picker --> and add validation to add specific format, maybe with regex
input validtion for all types --> make seconds be at least 1, with regex
validate to catch when mph breaks with a near divide by zero. maybe a run must be at least 5 minutes long.
when mph calc is over 20 shoot an error. 
don't allow a date in the future
run has to be less than 24 hours on creating and edit



create two different layouts for daily create run to include the datepicker
and another for weekly to include the weekly date picker

replace welcome.blade with login template and setup the rerouting depending on login or not


add counts for number of times achieved a 5k 10k half marathon full marathon

create admin panel to see every user. last login date. active users this week/month. last 10 runs across all users.

add pagination to history so it only shows 15 at a time.
