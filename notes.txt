Thursday: What I really want to figure out today is how to set weekly and monthly goals.

a weekly goal needs to be tied to a user id and a week
a monthly goal needs to be tied to a user id and a month 


storing month week year in runs table is probably overkill. can I adjust the quries to only go off the date? 
How I handle this could impact how I do the goals

its not how I store it that's the issue. its how I query it.

Think I want to create a test table that has every week total miles starting with the first date entered.








add auth check on dashboard/

ADD/EDIT RUN:
date picker --> and add validation to add specific format, maybe with regex
input validtion for all types --> make seconds be at least 1, with regex
validate to catch when mph breaks with a near divide by zero. maybe a run must be at least 5 minutes long.
when mph calc is over 20 shoot an error. 
don't allow a date in the future
run has to be less than 24 hours on creating and edit



create two different layouts for daily create run to include the datepicker
and another for weekly to include the weekly date picker

replace welcome.blade with login template and setup the rerouting depending on login or not


add counts for number of times achieved a 5k 10k half marathon full marathon

create admin panel to see every user. last login date. active users this week/month. last 10 runs across all users.

add pagination to history so it only shows 15 at a time.
